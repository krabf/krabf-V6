title: About
---

Hi, my name is Kush (she/her) and I’m an independent filmmaker and video editor based in Cebu City, Philippines. 
I’m currently working as a Live Action Video Editor at [fewStones](https://fewstones.com/), a Singapore-based video production company.
Previously, I helped mental health companies and practitioners such as [Integrated Psychiatry Institute](https://psychiatryinstitute.com/) and [Performance Excellence & Recovery Consulting](https://www.trainwithperc.com) with video and content. I have been a Notion Ambassador since November 2020 and I create [Notion templates](https://krabf.gumroad.com) on the side and I hope Notioners find them very useful. You can visit my [work site](https://krabf.com/works) to view some of the stuff I’ve edited and produced.

Outside of work, I am a self-proclaimed serial hobbyist. Recently, I've taken a great interest in brewing coffee at home. I put a lot of time and effort into writing coffee reviews, and I'm working on transferring those to this blog, so please be patient. I love photography as well, and I try to publish my photos online, though I am generally shy about doing this. On any given day, I watch one or two movies. I am fascinated by technology, especially ethical and useful technologies. I enjoy tinkering with the Internet. And I spend most of my time 
these days thinking about the web—how it works, how it’s changing, and how we can make it a better place. The World Wide Web has always fascinated me. I feel as though I grew up on the Internet, and that it has taught me a lot of what I know. Technology has often found ways to pull me into new hobbies like making websites. I’ve made lots of websites that I forgot most of them.

If you want to get to know more about me or collaborate, please send me an [email](mailto:krabfx@gmail.com).

# Tools I Use

## Gear

I photograph with the [Leica M10-R](https://leica-camera.com/en-int/photography/cameras/m/m10-r-black/details) with [Summilux 35mm f/1.4](https://leica-camera.com/en-int/photography/lenses/m/summilux-m-35mm-f1-4-asph-black) as my main lens (probably my only lens). I sometimes use my trusty Sony A7RII for video and photo with the [Sony 16-50mm f/3.5-5.6 OSS](https://www.sony.com.ph/electronics/camera-lenses/selp1650) and [Sony FE 24-240mm f/3.5-6.3 OSS](https://www.sony.com.ph/electronics/camera-lenses/sel24240). Currently using the A7RII as a webcam.

My workstation consists of a [2021 16" M1 Max MacBook Pro](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP858?locale=en_US). I'm using the [Apple Studio Display](https://www.apple.com/ph/studio-display/) as my monitor and I don't have any complaints. I slightly got into mechanical keyboards and I'm still thinking if I should have another hobby as an excuse for a TGR Jane. Right now I'm using a [Keychron Q1 Knob QMK](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-q2-qmk-custom-mechanical-keyboard?variant=40218169147481) and I rock a "three-input kind of person" using the Magic Trackpad 2 and Magic Mouse. I recently learned this is how [MKBHD](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cxp-FCDUkNc&t=459) works when editing or browsing! My headphones is still the [ATHM40x](https://www.audio-technica.com/en-eu/ath-m40x) and still use the 2nd gen [AirPods](https://www.apple.com/ph/shop/product/MV7N2ZA/A/airpods-with-charging-case) 

I use [Samsung T7 1TB](https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/memory-storage/portable-solid-state-drives/portable-ssd-t7-usb-3-2-1tb--gray--mu-pc1t0t-am/) SSD and it's blazing fast and [WD Elements 14TB](https://www.westerndigital.com/en-ap/products/external-drives/wd-elements-desktop-usb-3-0-hdd#WDBBKG0140HBK-AESN) HDD for archiving.

I had a basic setup that worked for me. As my needs grew and I required more performance, I was fortunate enough to upgrade my tools. I have invested both time and money in acquiring these tools, and I believe the investment has been well worth it.


## Apps and Software

I use a lot of applications and software to increase my productivity both at work and in my personal life. 

For work, I primarily use [Adobe Creative Cloud](https://www.adobe.com/ph_en/creativecloud.html), specifically Premiere Pro and After Effects, which are paid for by my employer, saving me a significant amount of money. I use [Script Editor](https://support.apple.com/en-ph/guide/script-editor/welcome/mac) to automatically create folders when I have new projects coming in. I also use [Capture One](https://www.captureone.com/en) for photo editing, [Figma](https://www.figma.com) for interface design, [DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve) for color grading practice, and PluralEyes4 for seamless audio and video syncing. [Shutter Encoder](https://www.shutterencoder.com/) is my preferred tool for converting and encoding videos and audio, as it is more efficient than HandBrake. [ScreenFlow](https://www.telestream.net/screenflow/) is a great help in creating tutorials and workflow samples through video. For file archiving and compression, I use [Keka](https://www.keka.io/) and [The Unarchiver](https://theunarchiver.com/), respectively, as they are both reliable and do not slow down my workflow when handling large files. [Transmit](https://panic.com/transmit/) is my preferred tool for transferring files between work and personal cloud services.

All coding happens in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and sometimes in [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), and [iTerm](https://iterm2.com/).

I use [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) and [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) as Spotlight replacements to quickly search for files and information in my system. While I have been using Alfred for years, I may switch to Raycast due to its additional features. For faster workflow, I rely on utility apps like [Dropzone](https://aptonic.com/) to move and copy files to different folders, [Maccy,](https://maccy.app/) as my clipboard manager, [Shottr](https://shottr.cc/) as my screenshot tool, and [Tot](https://tot.rocks/) is my very handy text companion. [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) is my tool of choice for project management, while [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) helps me manage my personal knowledge. I use [Arc](https://arc.net/), Firefox, and Safari as my web browsers and I read RSS feeds and newsletters with [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com/). I prefer using [Cron](https://cron.com/) as my calendar and [Calendar 366](https://nspektor.com/en) to access it through the menu bar. I also use other utility apps on the menu bar, and [Bartender's](https://www.macbartender.com/) free version helps me keep them organized.

These are only a few of the many applications I regularly use for work and personal use, and I find them to be instrumental in my productivity and efficiency.

I understand that this is a long list of apps and software, but please note that I do not receive any compensation for mentioning them.\
