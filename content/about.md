Hi, my name is Kush (she/her) and I’m an independent filmmaker and video editor based in Cebu City, Philippines. I’m currently working as a Live Action Video Editor at [fewStones](https://fewstones.com/), a Singapore-based video production company. Previosuly, I helped mental health companies such as [Integrated Psychiatry Institute](https://psychiatryinstitute.com/) and [@trainwithperc](https://www.trainwithperc.com) with video and content. I have been a Notion Ambassador since November 2020 and I create free [Notion templates](https://krabf.gumroad.com/) on the side and I hope Notioners find them very useful. Check out my [work site](https://kushaiah.webflow.io/).
  
Outside of work I am a self-proclaimed serial hobbyist. Recently I've taken a great interest in brewing coffee at home. I put a lot of time and effort into writing coffee reviews, and I'm working on transferring those to this blog, so please be patient. I love photography as well, and I try to publish my photos online, though I am generally shy about doing this. On any given day, I watch one or two movies. I am fascinated by technology, especially ethical and useful technologies. I enjoy tinkering with the Internet. And I spend most of my time these days thinking about the web—how it works, how it’s changing, and how we can make it a better place. The World Wide Web has always fascinated me. I feel as though I grew up on the Internet, and that it has taught me a lot of what I know. Technology has often found ways to pull me into new hobbies.

I’m heavily inspired by [Craig Mod](https://craigmod.com/) and I hope that one day I’ll be able to afford his membership program. 

I am also obsessed with [Fleabag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleabag).
