### Personal website, built with Hugo

This is the source code for [krabf.com](https://www.krabf.com), a digital garden, a lifetime project filled with growing reviews, writings, and musing.
It's open source to let people poke around and get ideas for their own garden.

This site is created with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), hosted in [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), and distributed globally via [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/). Fonts in use are [IBM Plex Serif](https://www.ibm.com/plex/) and [IBM Plex Mono](https://github.com/IBM/plex). Posts are written in HTML and Markdown. Spent countless of hours with the CSS. All by tweaking and learning other people's work and watching YouTube videos and reading some blog posts/docs. I donâ€™t run analytics or visitor tracking of any kind. I am actively working to increase the accessibility and usability of my website to everyone. If you find some issues, please let me know.
