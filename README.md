### New website, built with Hugo, inspired by Sebastian De Deyne

This is the source code for krabf.com, a digital garden, a lifetime project filled with growing reviews, writings, and musing.
It's open source to let people poke around and get ideas for their own garden.

Simply built with Hugo, posts are in markdown.
